# Employee_Management_System
  The Employee Management System (EMS) is a streamlined web-based application 
designed to efficiently manage employee records. This system operates on a local server, 
utilizing the Streamlit library in Python for the front end and directly connecting to a 
PostgreSQL database using psycopg2. The primary objective of this project is to create 
an intuitive and effective platform for handling basic employee data operations such as 
adding, updating, viewing, and deleting records.

The EMS leverages a minimalist yet powerful technology stack. The front end is built 
using the Streamlit library, known for its simplicity and capability to create interactive 
web interfaces. For the database, PostgreSQL is selected for its robustness and 
reliability, with psycopg2 facilitating direct communication between the application and 
the database.
